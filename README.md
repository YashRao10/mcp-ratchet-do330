# mcp-ratchet — DO-330 Tool Qualification Study

A worked example of taking a real AI-adjacent tool through the DO-330 tool
qualification process: what role it plays in a DO-178C activity, whether it
needs to be qualified at all, at what Tool Qualification Level, what its Tool
Operational Requirements are, how you would verify them, and an honest verdict
on how far the qualification actually goes.

The tool under study is [**mcp-ratchet**](https://github.com/YashRao10/mcp-ratchet)
— a security scanner and runtime drift monitor for MCP (Model Context
Protocol) servers. This study looks specifically at its **deterministic
tool-surface drift-detection function** used as a configuration-integrity
control for a separately-qualified AI verification tool.

## Why this is worth doing

If a DO-178C program credits an LLM-backed assistant (exposed over MCP) as a
verification tool, that assistant needs DO-330 qualification. A documented
hazard for MCP tools is that a server's advertised tool definitions can change
after a human approved them. A drift monitor that fingerprints the qualified
tool's interface and detects any post-approval change is a natural
configuration-integrity control — but if its "no drift" output is credited,
the monitor itself comes into scope for qualification. This study works that
question end to end. There is very little public material on qualifying
anything in the AI toolchain under DO-330.

**Status:** the five-document set is complete. Verdict (MR-TQ-005 §4): the
drift-detection function at mcp-ratchet commit `907c8a9` meets TOR-1..11 and is
a defensible **candidate for TQL-5 under Criteria 3**, conditional on independent
verification of the MR-TQ-004 results (the one item the study leaves open). The
three source defects it turned up were fixed on mcp-ratchet before verification
(commits `78d5971`, `a054e4a`, `907c8a9`).

## Scope discipline

This study does not reproduce the paywalled RTCA DO-330 text, and does not
assert specific per-TQL objective counts from its tables. TQL-determination
criteria are cited from named secondary sources. Where the standard's exact
content is needed and not independently confirmable, the study says so rather
than guessing — the same discipline used in the sibling `AAS-TQ-002` study.
